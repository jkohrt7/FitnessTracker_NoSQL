## Installation

To see a demonstration of the application, you don't need to install anything. It's hosted [here on Heroku](https://nosql-exercise-application1.herokuapp.com/).

If you want to use your own database, you'll need to first install the following technologies:

-[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) -[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)

Afterwards, download the project files and navigate to the root folder in a terminal of your choice. Run `npm i` to get all the necessary dependencies, then `npm start` to run the project on `localhost:3001`. You can also use `npm run seed` to seed the database.

## Usage

The application gives you the option to add a new workout or continue the last workout, which is displayed above these two options. Every 'workout' contains information on a collection of exercises which will be visualized on the stats page; selecting one of the workout options brings you to a page where you can add these exercises to a workout instance.

When you've added all the exercises you want to a given workout, you can select complete to return to the main page, or dashboard in the top right to view a visual representation of your exercise statistics.
